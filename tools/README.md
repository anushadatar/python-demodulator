# RTL-SDR tools.

This directory contains some utility functions that can simplify making larger programs and visualizing data. They should be straightforward to integrate into existing programs as needed.
The two programs currently documented here are 
- [Filters](https://github.com/anushadatar/python-rtlsdr-tooling/blob/master/tools/filters.py)
- [Plotting Tools](https://github.com/anushadatar/python-rtlsdr-tooling/blob/master/tools/plots.py)
