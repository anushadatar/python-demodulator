# Python RTL-SDR Tooling
Python-based signal demodulator with an RTL-SDR. For this project (done as a part of my Olin College SP19 Passionate Pursuit project), I used an RTL2832U software-defined framework to conduct various experiments in a several different envrionments, and I got my Amateur Extra class HAM radio certification.

As a last experience for this project, I decided to make a simple set of python demodulation tools - many of the frameworks that already exist are  propreitary and/or complicated to edit, so I wanted to create something simple to use and modify.

As part of that, I created a few frameworks:
- [An AM Radio Demodulation Framework](https://anushadatar.github.io/python-rtlsdr-tooling/am/)
- [An FM Radio Demodulation Framework](https://anushadatar.github.io/python-rtlsdr-tooling/fm/)
- [Tools to simplfy RTL-SDR use](https://anushadatar.github.io/python-rtlsdr-tooling/tools/)
