# Python RTL-SDR Demodulator
Python-based signal demodulator with an RTL-SDR. For this project (done as a part of my Olin College SP19 Passionate Pursuit project), I used an RTL2832U software-defined framework to conduct various experiments in a several different envrionments, and I got my Amateur Extra class HAM radio certification.

As a last experience for this project, I decided to make a simple set of python demodulation tools - many of the frameworks that already exist are  propreitary and/or complicated to edit, so I wanted to create something simple to use and modify.

As part of that, I created a few (hopefully easy to modify) frameworks:
- [An AM Radio Demodulation Framework](https://github.com/anushadatar/python-demodulator/tree/master/am)
- [An FM Radio Demodulation Framework](https://github.com/anushadatar/python-demodulator/tree/master/fm)
- [Tools to simplfy RTL-SDR use](https://github.com/anushadatar/python-demodulator/tree/master/tools)
