# Python RTL-SDR Demodulator
Python-based signal demodulator with an RTL-SDR. For this project, I used an  
RTL2832U software-defined framework to conduct various experiments in a several
different envrionments, and I got my Amateur Extra class HAM radio certification.

As a last experience for this project, I decided to make a simple set of 
python demodulation tools - many of the frameworks that already exist are 
propreitary and/or complicated to edit, so I wanted to create something
simple to use and modify.

TODO Add links to each thing implemented
TODO Add a how to get started
